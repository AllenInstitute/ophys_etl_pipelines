# The ruby code that runs the LIMS strategies reads in the output.json
# produced by each module and uses it to set attributes in the LIMS
# database. The JSON parser in that code does not handle NaNs or Infs.
# Unfortunately, the ScanImage metadata prepended to the Mesoscope
# TIFF files includes several values that are set to Inf. This module
# provides some methods to sanitize the output data before it is written
# to the output.json.
